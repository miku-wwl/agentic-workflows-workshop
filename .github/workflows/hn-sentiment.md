# hn-sentiment

Create a ChatOps slash command called /hn-sentiment. When a user posts
a comment on a GitHub issue that starts with "/hn-sentiment <url>",
where <url> is a Hacker News story URL (e.g.
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12345), do the following:
1) Extract the Hacker News item ID from the URL.
2) Fetch up to 50 top-level comments for that story from the Hacker
   News API.
3) Perform sentiment analysis on the comment text, classifying each
   comment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
4) Produce a summary that shows: the overall sentiment (with percentage
   breakdown), the top 3 most positive comments (with excerpt), and
   the top 3 most negative comments (with excerpt).
5) Reply to the original issue comment with the analysis formatted in
   Markdown.
If no URL is provided or the URL is not a valid Hacker News item,
reply with a helpful error message.
